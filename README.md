# Find the top 10 restaurants in a chosen location - API project

<p> This project was assigned at the CF:girls coding course to practice working with APIs.</p>

<p> The code in the restaurant_search notebook takes in two inputs: location and a choice of meal. It then outputs a dataframe with a list of
the top 10 restaurants (according to their rating) along with some basic information and the hygiene rating (if available).</p>
<p>The two APIs used in this project were zomato and the government food agency APIs.</p>
